<p class = "desc">
The major issues impacting animals have changed over the years, but our mission remains the same: To create a more humane society.  Currently, more than 41,000 species have been assessed to be under threat of extinction according to the IUCN.
See some of the animals that are soon to be wiped of existence if we do not intervene!
As our modern society gets more resource-intensive, natural spaces are shrinking and wildlife numbers are declining.Reports show global wildlife populations have plummeted by 69% on average since 1970. While there have been amazing and inspirational wildlife successes and stories in the past, many animals are still endangered mostly due to unsustainable human-led activities.

<p class = "a-story_desc">In the Okavango Delta area of Botswana. African bush elephants are classified as vulnerable, with their numbers falling due to habitat loss and poaching.
    The latest assessments highlight a broadscale decline in African elephant numbers across the continent. The number of African forest elephants fell by more than 86% over a period of 31 years, while the population of African savanna elephants decreased by at least 60% over the last 50 years, according to the assessments.

    <p class = "a-story_desc">Lonesome George was the last surviving Pinta Island tortoise, native only to the Galapagos Islands. Until 2012, Pinta Island tortoises were extinct in the wild. On June 24, 2012, Lonesome George died, and the Pinta Island tortoise became entirely extinct.
        During the 1800s, whalers removed large numbers of Pinta tortoises as a food resource on their long journeys. By the early 20th century, the Pinta tortoise was likely ecologically extinct. Fishermen also opportunistically slaughtered tortoises through the mid 1900s.

        <p class = "a-story_desc">The luxurious waterproof coat that insulates sea otters from the chilly waters that they inhabit almost led to its extinction. A target of the commercial fur trade, the species was almost wiped out, with only some 2,000 of an estimated 300,000 left by 1911. 
            Hunted to near extinction in the 18th and 19th centuries, sea otters finally gained protections with the signing of the International Fur Seal Treaty of 1911. In the 1970s, they received additional safeguarding under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Endangered Species Act. Worldwide, sea otters have slowly recovered but still stand far below their historical population numbers.

            <p class = "a-story_desc">Scientists have been unable to thoroughly study the distribution and abundance of the Cross River gorilla until the last decade or so. 
                Because the gorillas are wary of humans and inhabit rugged territory, scientists have been unable to count many of these gorillas directly. Instead, researchers have used indirect signs, such as nest counts, and estimated range sizes to determine that there are only about 200 to 300 of these gorillas left in the wild. Cross River gorillas are scattered in at least 11 groups across the lowland montane forests and rainforests of Cameroon and Nigeria, an area of 3,000 square miles, or about twice the size of Rhode Island.

                <p class = "a-story_desc">Irrawaddy dolphins are found in coastal areas in South and Southeast Asia, and in three rivers: the Ayeyarwady (Myanmar), the Mahakam (Indonesian Borneo) and the Mekong. The Mekong River Irrawaddy dolphins inhabit a 118-mile stretch of the river between Cambodia and Lao PDR and are scarceâ€”just 92 individuals are estimated to still exist. These dolphins have a bulging forehead, short beak, and 12-19 teeth on each side of both jaws..
