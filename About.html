<p class = "desc">
The major issues impacting animals have changed over the years, but our mission remains the same: To create a more humane society.  Currently, more than 41,000 species have been assessed to be under threat of extinction according to the IUCN.
See some of the animals that are soon to be wiped of existence if we do not intervene!

While there have been amazing and inspirational wildlife successes and stories in the past, many animals are still endangered mostly due to unsustainable human-led activities.
