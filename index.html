      <p class="desc">Of the many things humans have impacted, one of the most precious things we've seen go are various extinct species. Nature coexists in
        peace, and we disrupt it with many of our industrial impacts. We are a group who believes in minimizing our actions for the sake of the many species who hav lost their history to us.
         Our trash, our factories, and our overpopulation results in deforestation and climate change, and though we can always choose better, we can never reverse our actions. 
         Dodos and Tasmanian Devils are two of our largest impact, recently extinct species, and we can never repair the ecosystme they left behind. Many endangered species now suffer the same fate, 
         unless we can make a global impact for the better.
