      <p class="desc">Of the many things humans have impacted, one of the most precious things we've seen go are various extinct species. Nature coexists in
        peace, and we disrupt it with many of our industrial impacts. We are a group who believes in minimizing our actions for the sake of the many species who hav lost their history to us.
         Our trash, our factories, and our overpopulation results in deforestation and climate change, and though we can always choose better, we can never reverse our actions. 
         Dodos and Tasmanian Devils are two of our largest impact, recently extinct species, and we can never repair the ecosystem they left behind. Many endangered species now suffer the same fate, 
         unless we can make a global impact for the better.</p>

         <p class="desc">   With some heart, you can help as well! Whether it's simply cleaning up your local beach or using eco-friendly items, every choice makes all the difference. We've partnered with several organizations
          to assist with our cause. Many take help in the form of both donations and volunteer work, using the given funds towards preserving endangered species and their habitats. A few organizations also work 
          with endangered species breeding programs, ensuring that not only are they safe in the wilderness, but they can thrive and eventually return to their natural habitats. </p>

          <p class="desc"> Think about how you can make a change for the better of all the other living beings we share the world with! </p>
